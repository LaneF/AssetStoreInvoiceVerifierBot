# Asset Store Invoice Verifier Bot
This is a Discord bot that will verify Invoice Numbers from the Unity Asset Store API

# How To Setup
This bot is based on the nice tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok

You need to...
1. Create a Application/Bot through Discord's developer dashboard.
2. Create a Repl.it which runs, logs in the bot, and reads messages.
3. Add the bot to your server with the correct permissions (read messages, manage messages, assign roles)
4. In your Repl.it add a .env file with the Discord Bot Token and Unity Store API Key variables.
5. Use UptimeRobot to ping your Repl.it to keep it from sleeping after being inactive for an hour.
6. Test your bot in your guild server.
